# Active Directory Security Enhancement Project 🛡️

## Overview
The Active Directory Security Enhancement Project focuses on fortifying the organization's Active Directory (AD) environment, aligning with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST. This initiative encompasses a thorough analysis, implementation, and optimization of security measures within Active Directory to bolster cybersecurity defenses and enhance resilience against unauthorized access.

## Objectives 🎯

1. **Access Control Review and Implementation 🚪:**
   - Conduct an in-depth analysis of current AD user and group permissions.
   - Implement the principle of least privilege to ensure minimum necessary permissions.
   - Utilize group policies to enforce strong password policies and account lockout settings.

2. **Audit and Monitoring Implementation 📊:**
   - Configure AD audit policies to track critical security events.
   - Implement centralized logging for AD events to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities or policy violations.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Integration 🔐:**
   - Integrate MFA for critical AD accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
   - Evaluate and implement MFA solutions compatible with AD infrastructure.

4. **Privileged Access Management (PAM) 🛑:**
   - Implement PAM solutions to manage, control, and monitor access within AD.
   - Enforce just-in-time privileged access and session recording for administrative accounts.

5. **Security Patching and Updates 🔄:**
   - Develop and implement a regular patch management strategy for AD servers.
   - Ensure timely installation of security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities.

6. **Incident Response Planning 🚨:**
   - Develop an incident response plan specific to AD security incidents.
   - Conduct tabletop exercises to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.

## Deliverables 📦

1. Detailed documentation of AD security configurations and changes made.
2. Incident response plan with step-by-step procedures.
3. Training materials for end-users and IT staff on secure AD practices.
4. Post-implementation report with insights into security improvements and recommendations for ongoing enhancements.
